# UX

## Website owner business goals

The website owner is the company, Cocktails@Home. The goal of the website is to provide users with an online tool to find cocktail receipes that they can use at home. The owner wants Cocktails@Home to be the 'go-to' website when looking for cocktail recepies. 

## User goals

- User is able to find a cocktail receipe based on the name of the cocktail or liquer base of the cocktail
- User is able to create an account in order to save "favourite" cocktail receipes 
- Logged in user is able to upload new receipes for others to view

## User stories

User 1: Katie is 20, lives in london and loves cocktails. She tends to only like sweet cocktails but wants to find and try other other cocktails. As cocktails are expensive in London, she wants to find cheaper ways to make them from home. 

User 2: Peter is 40 and wants to have some friends over for a cocktail party. He has his favourites but wants to find some that all his guests might like.
